# Introduction

This directory contains the assignments for PFDA Programming For Data Analytics

## Assignment 02

Northern bank holdays

Write a program called assignment02-bankholdiays.py

The program should print out the dates of the bank holidays that happen in northern Ireland.

Last few marks (ie this is more tricky)

Modify the program to print the bank holidays that are unique to northern Ireland (i.e. do not happen elsewhere in the UK) you can choose if you want to use the name or the date of the holiday to decide if it is unique.

assignment02-bankholidays.py  -- code 
assignment02-bankholidays.txt -- output of run 

## Assignment 03

Create a notebook called assignment03-pie.ipynb

The note book should have a nice pie chart of peoples email domains in the csv file at the url

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download

This csv file has 1000 people. You may download the data or link to it.

Marks will be given for:

Just creating the pie chart
Making it look nice
As always your code should be well laid out.

If you are having difficulties, know I will be doing more on Pie charts later in this module.

## Assignment 05

The Differences between the male and female populate by age in Ireland


### Part 1 70%
Write a jupyter notebook that analyses the differences between the sexes by age in Ireland.

Weighted mean age (by sex)
The difference between the sexes by age
This part does not need to look at the regions.

ie You can take the notebook I used in the lectures and substitute the sexes for the regions.

## Assignment 06

Create a notebook called assignment_6_Weather.ipynb

Get the data from this link.

https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv

(This is different that the data I used in the lecture)

Plot:

- The temperature
- The mean temperature each day
- The mean temperature for each month
60% of the marks will be given for the above

For the last 40%

Plot:

- The Windspeed (there is data missing from this column)
- The rolling windspeed (say over 24 hours)
- The max windspeed for each day
The monthly mean of the daily max windspeeds (yer I am being nasty here)
You do not need to over comment your code. Marks will be given for how nice the plots are.
