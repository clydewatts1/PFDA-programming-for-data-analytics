This directory contains the assignments for PFDA Programming For Data Analytics

## Assignment 02

Northern bank holdays

Write a program called assignment02-bankholdiays.py

The program should print out the dates of the bank holidays that happen in northern Ireland.

Last few marks (ie this is more tricky)

Modify the program to print the bank holidays that are unique to northern Ireland (i.e. do not happen elsewhere in the UK) you can choose if you want to use the name or the date of the holiday to decide if it is unique.

Create a notebook called assignment03-pie.ipynb

The note book should have a nice pie chart of peoples email domains in the csv file at the url

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download

This csv file has 1000 people. You may download the data or link to it.

Marks will be given for:

Just creating the pie chart
Making it look nice
As always your code should be well laid out.

If you are having difficulties, know I will be doing more on Pie charts later in this module.
